/*
 * A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is initially 
 * located on one bank of the river (position 0) and wants to get to the opposite 
 * bank (position X+1). Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the river.
 * 
 * You are given an array A consisting of N integers representing the falling 
 * leaves. A[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured 
 * in seconds.
 * 
 * The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side 
 * of the river. The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every position 
 * across the river from 1 to X (that is, we want to find the earliest moment 
 * when all the positions from 1 to X are covered by leaves). You may assume that 
 * the speed of the current in the river is negligibly small, i.e. the leaves 
 * do not change their positions once they fall in the river.
 * 
 * For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:
 * 
 *   A[0] = 1
 *   A[1] = 3
 *   A[2] = 1
 *   A[3] = 4
 *   A[4] = 2
 *   A[5] = 3
 *   A[6] = 5
 *   A[7] = 4
 * In second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. This is the earliest time when 
 * leaves appear in every position across the river.
 * 
 * Write a function:
 * 
 * class Solution { public int solution(int X, int[] A); }
 * 
 * that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers and integer X, 
 * returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.
 * 
 * If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the function 
 * should return âˆ’1.
 * 
 * For example, given X = 5 and array A such that:
 * 
 *   A[0] = 1
 *   A[1] = 3
 *   A[2] = 1
 *   A[3] = 4
 *   A[4] = 2
 *   A[5] = 3
 *   A[6] = 5
 *   A[7] = 4
 * the function should return 6, as explained above.
 * 
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * 
 * N and X are integers within the range [1..100,000];
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..X].
